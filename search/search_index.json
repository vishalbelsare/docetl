This step helps in consolidating different variations or brand names of the same medication. For example, step 1 might extract \"Ibuprofen\" and \"Motrin 800mg\" as separate medications, and step 3 might resolve them to a single \"Ibuprofen\" entry.</li> <li>Summary Generation: For each unique medication, generate a summary of side effects and therapeutic uses based on information from all relevant transcripts.</li> </ol> <p>Create a file named <code>pipeline.yaml</code> with the following structure:</p> <p>Pipeline Structure</p> <pre><code>datasets:\n  transcripts:\n    path: medical_transcripts.json\n    type: file\n\ndefault_model: gpt-4o-mini\n\nsystem_prompt: # This is optional, but recommended for better performance.

For example, you could update the <code>extract_medications</code> prompt to only list medications related to cardiovascular diseases.</p> How can I improve the accuracy of medication name resolution? <p>The <code>resolve_medications</code> operation uses a blocking threshold and comparison prompt to identify similar medication names. Learn more about how to configure this operation in the resolve operation documentation. To automatically find the optimal blocking threshold for your data, you can invoke the optimizer, as described in the optimization documentation.</p> Can I process other types of medical documents with this pipeline? <p>Yes, you can adapt this pipeline to process other types of medical documents by modifying the input data format and adjusting the prompts in each operation. For example, you could use it to analyze discharge summaries, clinical notes, or research papers by updating the extraction and summarization prompts accordingly.</p> How can I optimize the performance of this pipeline? <p>If you're unsure about the optimal configuration for your specific use case, you can use DocETL's optimizer, which can be invoked using <code>docetl build</code> instead of <code>docetl run</code>. Learn more about the optimizer in the optimization documentation.</p> How can I use the pandas integration? <p>DocETL provides a pandas integration for a few operators (map, filter, merge, agg).

It works as follows:\n        1. The input group is initially divided into smaller batches for efficient processing.\n        2. The method performs an initial round of folding operations on these batches.\n        3. After the first round of folds, a few merges are performed to estimate the merge runtime.\n        4. Based on the estimated merge runtime and observed fold runtime, it calculates the optimal number of parallel folds. Subsequent rounds of folding are then performed concurrently, with the number of parallel folds determined by the runtime estimates.\n        5. The folding process repeats in rounds, progressively reducing the number of items to be processed.\n        6. Once all folding operations are complete, the method recursively performs final merges on the fold results to combine them into a final result.\n        7. Throughout this process, the method may adjust the number of parallel folds based on updated performance metrics (i.e., fold and merge runtimes) to maintain efficiency.\n\n        Args:\n            key (Tuple): The reduce key tuple for the group.\n            group_list (List[Dict]): The list of items in the group to be processed.\n\n        Returns:\n            Tuple[Optional[Dict], float]: A tuple containing the final merged result (or None if processing failed)\n            and the total cost of the operation.\n        \"\"\"\n        fold_batch_size = self.config[\"fold_batch_size\"]\n        merge_batch_size = self.config[\"merge_batch_size\"]\n        total_cost = 0\n        prompts = []\n\n        def calculate_num_parallel_folds():\n            fold_time, fold_default = self.get_fold_time()\n            merge_time, merge_default = self.get_merge_time()\n            num_group_items = len(group_list)\n            return (\n                max(\n                    1,\n                    int(\n                        (fold_time * num_group_items * math.log(merge_batch_size))\n                        / (fold_batch_size * merge_time)\n                    ),\n                ),\n                fold_default or merge_default,\n            )\n\n        num_parallel_folds, used_default_times = calculate_num_parallel_folds()\n        fold_results = []\n        remaining_items = group_list\n\n        if self.config.get(\"persist_intermediates\", False):\n            self.intermediates[key] = []\n            iter_count = 0\n\n        # Parallel folding and merging\n        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_threads) as executor:\n            while remaining_items:\n                # Folding phase\n                fold_futures = []\n                for i in range(min(num_parallel_folds, len(remaining_items))):\n                    batch = remaining_items[:fold_batch_size]\n                    remaining_items = remaining_items[fold_batch_size:]\n                    current_output = fold_results[i] if i &lt;

The reduce operation is defined by the following prompt:\n\n        Reduce Operation Prompt:\n        {op_config['prompt']}\n\n        Sample Input Data (first 2 items):\n        {json.dumps(sample_input[:2], indent=2)}\n\n        We have determined that value sampling should be enabled for this reduce operation. Value sampling is a technique used to process only a subset of the input data for each reduce key, rather than processing all items. This can significantly reduce processing time and costs for very large datasets, especially when the reduce operation doesn't require looking at every single item to produce a good result (e.g., summarization tasks).\n\n        Now we need to choose the most appropriate sampling method. The available methods are:\n\n        1. \"random\": Randomly select a subset of values.\n        Example: In a customer review analysis task, randomly selecting a subset of reviews to summarize the overall sentiment.\n\n        2. \"cluster\": Use K-means clustering to select representative samples.\n        Example: In a document categorization task, clustering documents based on their content and selecting representative documents from each cluster to determine the overall categories.\n\n        3. \"sem_sim\": Use semantic similarity to select the most relevant samples to a query text.\n        Example: In a news article summarization task, selecting articles that are semantically similar to a query like \"Major economic events of {{reduce_key}}\" to produce a focused summary.\n\n        Based on the reduce operation prompt, the nature of the task, and the sample input data, which sampling method would be most appropriate?\n\n        Provide your answer as either \"random\", \"cluster\", or \"sem_sim\", and explain your reasoning in detail. Consider the following in your explanation:\n        - The nature of the reduce task (e.g., summarization, aggregation, analysis)\n        - The structure and content of the input data\n        - The potential benefits and drawbacks of each sampling method for this specific task\n        \"\"\"\n\n        parameters = {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"method\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"random\", \"cluster\", \"sem_sim\"]},\n                \"explanation\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"method\", \"explanation\"],\n        }\n\n        response = self.llm_client.generate_rewrite(\n            [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n            system_prompt,\n            parameters,\n        )\n        result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)\n        method = result[\"method\"]\n\n        value_sampling_config = {\n            \"enabled\": True,\n            \"method\": method,\n            \"sample_size\": 100,  # Default sample size\n            \"embedding_model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n        }\n\n        if method in [\"cluster\", \"sem_sim\"]:\n            # Determine embedding keys\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            For the {method} sampling method, we need to determine which keys from the input data should be used for generating embeddings.\n\n            Input data keys:\n            {', '.join(sample_input[0].keys())}\n\n            Sample Input Data:\n            {json.dumps(sample_input[0], indent=2)[:1000]}...\n\n            Based on the reduce operation prompt and the sample input data, which keys should be used for generating embeddings? Use keys that will create meaningful embeddings (i.e., not id-related keys).\n            Provide your answer as a list of key names that is a subset of the input data keys. You should pick only the 1-3 keys that are necessary for generating meaningful embeddings, that have relatively short values.\n            \"\"\"\n\n            parameters = {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"embedding_keys\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n                    \"explanation\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"embedding_keys\", \"explanation\"],\n            }\n\n            response = self.llm_client.generate_rewrite(\n                [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n                system_prompt,\n                parameters,\n            )\n            result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)\n            # TODO: validate that these exist\n            embedding_keys = result[\"embedding_keys\"]\n            for key in result[\"embedding_keys\"]:\n                if key not in sample_input[0]:\n                    embedding_keys.remove(key)\n\n            if not embedding_keys:\n                # Select the reduce key\n                self.console.log(\n                    \"No embedding keys found, selecting reduce key for embedding key\"\n                )\n                embedding_keys = (\n                    op_config[\"reduce_key\"]\n                    if isinstance(op_config[\"reduce_key\"], list)\n                    else [op_config[\"reduce_key\"]]\n                )\n\n            value_sampling_config[\"embedding_keys\"] = embedding_keys\n\n        if method == \"sem_sim\":\n            # Determine query text\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            For the semantic similarity (sem_sim) sampling method, we need to determine the query text to compare against when selecting samples.\n\n            Reduce Operation Prompt:\n            {op_config['prompt']}\n\n            The query text should be a Jinja template with access to the `reduce_key` variable.\n            Based on the reduce operation prompt, what would be an appropriate query text for selecting relevant samples?\n            \"\"\"\n\n            parameters = {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"query_text\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                    \"explanation\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"query_text\", \"explanation\"],\n            }\n\n            response = self.llm_client.generate_rewrite(\n                [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n                system_prompt,\n                parameters,\n            )\n            result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)\n            value_sampling_config[\"query_text\"] = result[\"query_text\"]\n\n        return value_sampling_config\n\n    def _is_associative(\n        self, op_config: Dict[str, Any], input_data: List[Dict[str, Any]]\n    ) -&gt; bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Determine if the reduce operation is associative.\n\n        This method analyzes the reduce operation configuration and a sample of the input data\n        to determine if the operation is associative (i.e., the order of combining elements\n        doesn't affect the final result).\n\n        Args:\n            op_config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration for the reduce operation.\n            input_data (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Input data for the reduce operation.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the operation is determined to be associative, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        system_prompt = (\n            \"You are an AI assistant helping to optimize data processing pipelines.\"\n        )\n\n        # Sample a subset of input data for analysis\n        sample_size = min(5, len(input_data))\n        sample_input = random.sample(input_data, sample_size)\n\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Analyze the following reduce operation and determine if it is associative:\n\n        Reduce Operation Prompt:\n        {op_config['prompt']}\n\n        Sample Input Data:\n        {json.dumps(sample_input, indent=2)[:1000]}...\n\n        Based on the reduce operation prompt, determine whether the order in which we process data matters.\n        Answer with 'yes' if order matters or 'no' if order doesn't matter.\n        Explain your reasoning briefly.\n\n        For example:\n        - Merging extracted key-value pairs from documents does not require order: combining {{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}} with {{\"city\": \"New York\", \"job\": \"Engineer\"}} yields the same result regardless of order\n        - Generating a timeline of events requires order: the order of events matters for maintaining chronological accuracy.\n\n        Consider these examples when determining whether the order in which we process data matters.

This rule will be used in the form: `eval(blocking_rule, {{\"left\": item1, \"right\": item2}})`.\n\n    Sample comparisons (note: these are just a few examples and may not represent all possible cases):\n    {json.dumps(sample_datas, indent=2)}\n\n    For context, here is the comparison prompt that will be used for the more expensive, detailed comparison:\n    {self.op_config.get('comparison_prompt', 'No comparison prompt provided.')}\n\n    Please generate ONE one-line blocking rule that adheres to the following criteria:\n    1. The rule should evaluate to True if the entities are possibly a match and require further comparison.\n    2. The rule should evaluate to False ONLY if the entities are definitely not a match.\n    3. The rule must be a single Python expression that can be evaluated using the eval() function.\n    4. The rule should be much faster to evaluate than the full comparison prompt.\n    5. The rule should capture the essence of the comparison prompt but in a simplified manner.\n    6. The rule should be general enough to work well on the entire dataset, not just these specific examples.\n    7. The rule should handle inconsistent casing by using string methods like .lower() when comparing string values.\n    8. The rule should err on the side of inclusivity - it's better to have false positives than false negatives.\n\n    Example structure of a one-line blocking rule:\n    \"(condition1) or (condition2) or (condition3)\"\n\n    Where conditions could be comparisons like:\n    \"left['{left_keys[0]}'].lower() == right['{right_keys[0]}'].lower()\"\n    \"abs(len(left['{left_keys[0]}']) - len(right['{right_keys[0]}'])) &lt;= 5\"\n    \"any(word in left['{left_keys[0]}'].lower() for word in right['{right_keys[0]}'].lower().split())\"\n\n    If there's no clear rule that can be generated based on the given information, return the string \"True\" to ensure all pairs are compared.\n\n    Remember, the primary goal of the blocking rule is to safely reduce the number of comparisons by quickly identifying pairs that are definitely not matches, while keeping all potential matches for further evaluation.\"\"\",\n            }\n        ]\n\n        for attempt in range(self.agent_max_retries):\n            response = self.llm_client.generate_rewrite(\n                messages,\n                \"You are an expert in entity resolution and Python programming.

This report analyzes shifts and trends in Democratic and Republican viewpoints from 1992, during the second presidential debate between George Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot, to 2023.\n\n## Republican Viewpoints\n### Early 1990s\nIn 1992, President George Bush emphasized a forward-looking approach to infrastructure, stating, \"We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country...$150 billion for improving the infrastructure.\" This statement indicated a commitment to substantial federal investment in infrastructure aimed at enhancing transportation networks.\n\n### 2000s\nMoving into the early 2000s, the Republican party maintained a focus on infrastructure but began to frame it within the context of economic growth and public-private partnerships. However, after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a noticeable shift. The party emphasized tax cuts and reducing regulation over large public investments in infrastructure.\n\n### Recent Years\nBy 2020 and 2021, under the Trump administration, the emphasis returned to infrastructure. However, the tone shifted towards emphasizing private sector involvement and deregulation rather than large public spending. The Republican approach became more fragmented, with some factions calling for aggressive infrastructure investment, while others remained cautious about expenditures.\n\n## Democratic Viewpoints\n### Early 1990s\nIn contrast, Governor Bill Clinton in 1992 proposed a more systematic investment strategy, noting, \"My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation.\" This highlighted a stronger emphasis on direct federal involvement in infrastructure as a means of fostering economic opportunity and job creation.\n\n### 2000s\nThrough the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Democratic party continued to push for comprehensive federal infrastructure plans, often attached to broader economic initiatives aimed at reducing inequality and spurring job growth. The party emphasized sustainable infrastructure and investments that address climate change.\n\n### Recent Years\nBy 2020, under the Biden administration, the Democrat viewpoint strongly advocated for significant infrastructure investments, combining traditional infrastructure with climate resilience. The American Jobs Plan symbolized this shift, proposing vast funds for transit systems, renewable energy projects, and rural broadband internet. The framing increasingly included social equity as a core component of infrastructure, influenced by movements advocating for racial and economic justice.\n\n## Agreements and Disagreements\n### Agreements\nDespite inherent differences, both parties have historically acknowledged the necessity of infrastructure investments for economic growth. Both Bush and Clinton in 1992 recognized infrastructure as vital for job creation, but diverged on the scope and funding mechanisms.\n\n### Disagreements\nOver the years, major disagreements have surfaced, particularly in funding approaches. The Republican party has increasingly favored private sector involvement and tax incentives, while Democrats have consistently pushed for robust federal spending and the incorporation of progressive values into infrastructure projects.\n\n## Influencing Factors\nThe evolution of viewpoints has often mirrored external events such as economic recessions, technological advancement, and social movements. The post-9/11 era and the 2008 financial crisis notably shifted priorities, with bipartisan discussions centered around recovery through infrastructure spending. Additionally, increasing awareness of climate change and social justice has over the years significantly influenced Democratic priorities, leading to a more inclusive and sustainable approach to infrastructure development.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe comparative analysis of Democratic and Republican viewpoints on infrastructure development from 1992 to 2023 reveals significant shifts in priorities and strategies. While both parties agree on the need for infrastructure improvements, their approaches and underlying philosophies continue to diverge, influenced by economic, social, and environmental factors.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>## The Evolution of Democratic and Republican Viewpoints on Crime and Gun Control: 1992-2023\n\n### Introduction\nThis report analyzes the shifting perspectives of the Democratic and Republican parties on the theme of \"Crime and Gun Control\" from 1992 to 2023. The exploration encompasses key debates, significant shifts in stance, party alignments, and influences from external events that shaped these viewpoints.\n\n### Democratic Party Viewpoints\n1. **Initial Stance (1992)**: In the early 1990s, the Democratic viewpoint, as exemplified by Governor Bill Clinton during the Second Presidential Debate in 1992, supported individual gun ownership but emphasized the necessity of regulation: \"I support the right to keep and bear arms...but I believe we have to have some way of checking handguns before they're sold.\"\n- **Trend**: This reflects a moderate position seeking to balance gun rights with public safety\u2014a common theme in Democratic rhetoric during this era that resonated with many constituents.\n\n2. **Shift Towards Stricter Gun Control (Late 1990s - 2000s)**: Following events such as the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, the Democratic Party increasingly advocated for more stringent gun control measures. The passing of the Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 marked a peak in regulatory measures supported by Democrats, emphasizing public safety over gun ownership rights.\n- **Quote Impact**: During this time, Democratic leaders often highlighted the need for legislative action to combat rising gun violence.\n\n3. **Response to Mass Shootings (2010s)**: The tragic events of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 ignited a renewed push for gun control from leading Democrats, including then-President Barack Obama. His call for \"common-sense gun laws\" marked a decisive moment in Democrat advocacy, focusing on background checks and bans on assault weapons.\n- **Quote**: Obama stated, \"We can't tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change.\"\n\n4. **Current Stance (2020s)**: The Democratic viewpoint has continued to become increasingly aligned with comprehensive gun control measures, including calls for universal background checks and red flag laws. In the wake of ongoing gun violence, this approach highlights a commitment to addressing systemic issues related to crime and public safety.\n\n### Republican Party Viewpoints\n1. **Consistent Support for Gun Rights (1992)**: In the same 1992 debate, President George Bush emphasized the rights of gun owners, stating, \"I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.\" This illustrates a steadfast commitment to Second Amendment rights that has characterized Republican positions over the years.\n- **Trend**: The Republican Party has traditionally promoted a pro-gun agenda, often resisting calls for stricter regulations or bans.\n\n2. **Response to Gun Control Advocacy (2000s)**: As Democrats pushed for stricter gun laws, Republicans increasingly framed these measures as infringements on individual rights. The response to high-profile shootings tended to focus on mental health and crime prevention rather than gun regulation.\n- **Disagreement**: Republicans consistently argued against the effectiveness of gun control, indicating belief in personal responsibility and the right to self-defense.\n\n3. **Shift to Increased Resistance (2010s)**: In the wake of prominent mass shootings, the Republican party maintained its focus on supporting gun rights, opposing federal gun control initiatives. Notable figures, such as former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch, articulated this resistance by stating, \"We are not going to let tragedies be used to violate our rights.\"\n- **Impact of External Events**: The rise of organizations like the NRA and increased gun ownership among constituents have fortified this pro-gun stance.\n\n4. **Contemporary Stance (2020s)**: Currently, the Republican viewpoint remains largely unchanged with an emphasis on individual rights to bear arms and skepticism regarding the effectiveness of gun control laws. Recent discussions around gun violence often focus on addressing crime through law enforcement and community safety programs instead of legislative gun restrictions.\n\n### Key Agreements and Disagreements\n- **Common Ground**: Both parties, at different times, have recognized the necessity for addressing gun-related violence but diverge on methods\u2014Democrats typically advocate for regulations while Republicans focus on rights preservation.\n- **Disagreements**: A significant divide exists on whether stricter gun laws equate to reduced crime rates, with Republicans consistently refuting this correlation, arguing instead that law-abiding citizens need access to firearms for self-defense.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe evolution of viewpoints on crime and gun control from 1992 to 2023 highlights a pronounced divergence between the Democratic and Republican parties. While Democrats have increasingly pursued stricter regulatory measures focused on public safety, Republicans have maintained a consistent advocacy for gun rights, underscoring a broader ideological conflict over individual freedoms and collective responsibility for public safety. The trajectories of both parties reflect their core values and responses to notable events impacting society.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>## Evolution of Drug Policy Viewpoints: 1996 to 2023\n\n### Summary of Democratic and Republican Perspectives on Drug Policy\nOver the years, drug policy has been a contentious issue in American politics, reflecting profound changes within both the Democratic and Republican parties. This report examines how views have evolved, highlighting significant trends, areas of agreement and disagreement, and influential external factors utilizing debates as primary reference points.\n\n### Democratic Party Trends:\n1. **Increased Emphasis on Comprehensive Approaches**:\n   - In the 1996 Clinton-Dole debate, President Bill Clinton stated, \"We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.\" This reflects a focus on enforcement as part of drug policy. However, Clinton's later years signaled a shift towards recognizing the need for treatment and prevention.\n\n2. **Emergence of Harm Reduction and Decriminalization**:\n   - Moving into the 2000s and beyond, Democrats began to embrace harm reduction strategies. For instance, during the 2020 Democratic primary debates, candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren emphasized decriminalization and treatment over incarceration, signifying a notable shift from punitive measures.\n\n3. **Growing Advocacy for Social Justice**:\n   - Recent years have seen an alignment with social justice movements, arguing that drug policy disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Kamala Harris in 2020 stated, \"We need to truly decriminalize marijuana and address the impact of the War on Drugs on communities of color.\"\n\n### Republican Party Trends:\n1. **Strong Focus on Law and Order**:\n   - During the 1996 debate, Senator Bob Dole reflected a traditional Republican stance, highlighting concerns over drugs without markedly addressing the social implications. \"The President doesn't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare...\" displays a defensive posture toward the political ramifications of drug issues.\n\n2. **Shift Towards Treatment and Prevention**:\n   - By the mid-2010s, there was a growing recognition of the opioid crisis, leading to a bipartisan approach promoting treatment. For example, former President Donald Trump, in addressing the opioid epidemic, stated, \"We have to take care of our people. We can't just lock them up.\"\n\n3. **Conflict Between Hardline Stance and Pragmatism**:\n   - Despite some shifts, many Republicans still emphasize law enforcement solutions. This tension was evident in the polarizing responses to marijuana legalization across states, with figures like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions taking a hardline stance against marijuana legalization, contrasting with more progressive approaches adopted by some Republican governors.\n\n### Areas of Agreement:\n1. **Opioid Crisis**:\n   - Both parties acknowledged the severity of the opioid epidemic, leading to legislation aimed at addressing addiction and treatment, indicating a rare consensus on the need for health-focused solutions.\n\n### Areas of Disagreement:\n1. **Approach to Drug Policy**:\n   - The Democratic party's shift towards decriminalization and harm reduction contrasts sharply with segments of the Republican party that still advocate for strict enforcement and criminalization of certain drugs.\n\n### Influential External Events and Factors:\n1. **The Opioid Crisis**:\n   - The rise of the opioid epidemic has forced both parties to reevaluate their positions on drug policy, pushing them towards more compassionate approaches focusing on addiction treatment.\n\n2. **Social Justice Movements**:\n   - The Black Lives Matter movement and other social justice efforts have altered the discourse surrounding drug policies, with increased focus on the need to rectify injustices in enforcement practices, particularly among minorities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThrough the years, drug policy viewpoints within the Democratic and Republican parties have experienced significant evolution, characterized by complex layers of agreement and disagreement. As social dynamics shift, both parties continue to grapple with finding a balanced approach towards a more effective drug policy that prioritizes health and social justice.\n</code></pre> <p>Upon inspecting the intermediates, it appears that the map operation is doing a good job at extracting relevant information.

For instance, it could include how the response to the 2008 financial crisis tied back to historical precedents, linking back to earlier debates about the importance of jobs and middle-class stability (like in the 1976 or 1992 debates).\n\n2. **Missing Quotes and Data Points**: The response could further bolster the analysis by incorporating additional quotes that illustrate the evolving narrative, particularly surrounding tax fairness and job creation. For example, quotes like George Bush in 1984 calling out \"working man\" perspectives against seemingly progressive taxation could enhance the depth. Additionally, quotes from debates emphasizing the impact of tax cuts on economic recovery and job growth\u2014such as Obama's focus on the automotive industry's recovery in 2012 or McCain's 'putting homeowners first'\u2014could provide essential context to the arguments for both parties.\n\n3. **Structure and Flow**: Overall, the output is fairly well-structured and maintains a logical flow, using headings appropriately to signal key sections. However, it may benefit from clearer subsections under each party's overview to delineate specific key points, such as 'Tax Policy', 'Job Creation', and 'Response to Economic Crises'. This would enhance readability and assist the reader in navigating the shifts in viewpoints. For example, adding bullet points or more vivid transitions between historical periods could clarify the evolution timeline. Moreover, resolving any redundancy (such as multiple mentions of similar themes across years) would streamline the narrative.\n</code></pre> <p>Check out the new output here to see the improvements made by the optimized pipeline!

The plan includes massive investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, as well as significant funding for research into new energy storage technologies.\n\n    However, the proposal has faced criticism from several quarters. Some Eastern European countries, particularly Poland and Hungary, argue that the timeline is too aggressive and could damage their economies, which are still heavily reliant on coal. Industry groups have also expressed concern about the potential for job losses in the fossil fuel sector.\n\n    Environmental groups have largely praised the initiative, with Greenpeace calling it 'a beacon of hope in the fight against climate change.' However, some activists argue that the 2050 target is not soon enough, given the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\n    The plan also includes provisions for a 'just transition,' with billions of euros allocated to retraining workers and supporting regions that will be most affected by the shift away from fossil fuels. Additionally, it proposes stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, and significant investments in public transportation and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\n    Experts are divided on the feasibility of the plan. Dr. Maria Schmidt, an energy policy researcher at the University of Berlin, says, 'While ambitious, this plan is achievable with the right political will and technological advancements.' However, Dr. John Smith from the London School of Economics warns, 'The costs and logistical challenges of such a rapid transition should not be underestimated.'\n\n    As the proposal moves forward for debate in the European Parliament, it's clear that 'Green Europe 2050' will be a defining issue for the continent in the coming years, with far-reaching implications for Europe's economy, environment, and global leadership in climate action.\"\n  }\n]\n</code></pre></p> <p>Output: <pre><code>[\n  {\n    \"main_topic\": \"EU Renewable Energy\",\n    \"summary\": \"The European Union has announced a plan called 'Green Europe 2050' to transition all member states to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
